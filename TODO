- Flesh out required database schema

- Implement object mapper to Dao
- Create object class to map to     // if that is the format we want for the returned dataset
- finish Dao methods

- Create the final, exposed methods for querying (and writing)

// decide on a method for constructing statements one by one, i.e. writing input + selecting filter + another filter + changing written input. etc.
